# Install libsvm

tar -xzvf libsvm-2.89.tar.gz
cd libsvm-2.89
make

cd ..

# Optional: Crawl fresh delicious data via BOSS (a previous crawl already included)

python crawl_delicious.py

# Generate a binary training set via two tags (pick from tags.txt)

python gen_training_test_set.py microsoft google

# Learn from the resulting training_data.txt and predict on test_data.txt

python autosvm.py training_set.txt test_set.txt

# Prints out the accuracy of the learner and saves model + prediction files in timestamped folder
